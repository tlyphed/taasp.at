### Workshop on Trends and Applications of Answer Set Programming

**The TAASP workshop series is jointly organized by research groups at Alpen-Adria-Universit채t Klagenfurt, Technische Universit채t Wien, and Universit채t Potsdam.**

**TAASP 2024 will be held on November 25-26, 2024 at Alpen-Adria-Universit채t Klagenfurt, Austria.**

_TAASP 2024 is the seventh workshop of its type, following [TAASP 2023](http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/events/taasp23/), [TAASP 2022](http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/events/taasp22/), [TAASP 2020](http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/events/taasp20/), [TAASP 2019](http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/events/taasp19/), [TAASP 2018](http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/events/taasp18/), [TAASP 2016](http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/events/taasp16/)._

#### Aims and Scope
Answer set programming (ASP) is a widely used declarative programming paradigm based on the stable-model semantics. Over the years, the formalism has been extended with new language elements, advanced evaluation techniques have been developed, and efficient and expressive systems have been realized. These advancements turned ASP into a rich modeling language which was successfully applied to various tasks in artificial intelligence and beyond, including combinatorial problems and knowledge-intense tasks. Driven by the needs of applications, ongoing research in the field comprises, for instance, the integration with other paradigms (such as constraint programming), distributed computation, temporal and stream reasoning. These developments aim at the ultimate goal of equipping ASP with the features needed for realizing modern information systems. This workshop focuses on recent trends in the area of ASP, including novel techniques for the evaluation of ASP programs, extensions of the formalism, integration with other formalisms, advancements of systems, and benchmark suites. Furthermore, discussions of applications of ASP and its extensions in AI and industry are welcome.
