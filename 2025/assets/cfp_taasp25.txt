                            TAASP 2025
    Workshop on Trends and Applications of Answer Set Programming
                       November 24-25, 2025

AIMS AND SCOPE
 Answer set programming (ASP) is a widely used declarative programming
 paradigm based on the stable-model semantics. Over the years, the
 formalism has been extended with new language elements, advanced
 evaluation techniques have been developed, and efficient and
 expressive systems have been realized. These advancements turned ASP
 into a rich modeling language that was successfully applied to
 various tasks in artificial intelligence and beyond, including
 combinatorial problems and knowledge-intense tasks. Driven by the
 needs of applications, ongoing research in the field comprises, for
 instance, the integration with other paradigms (such as constraint
 programming), distributed computation, temporal and stream reasoning.
 These developments aim at the ultimate goal of equipping ASP with the
 features needed for realizing modern information systems. This
 workshop focuses on recent trends in the area of ASP, including novel
 techniques for the evaluation of ASP programs, extensions of the
 formalism, integration with other formalisms, advancements of
 systems, and benchmark suites.  Furthermore, discussions of
 applications of ASP and its extensions in AI and industry are
 welcome.

SUBMISSIONS
 We welcome two categories of submissions:

 - full papers presenting original research (at most 15 pages plus
   references and optional appendix), and
 - extended abstracts of already published or preliminary research
   (at most 2 pages plus references and optional appendix).

 All submissions should be in the Springer LNCS format:

IMPORTANT DATES
 Paper submission deadline:            October 6, 2025
 Author notification:                  November 3, 2025
 Camera-ready articles due:            November 17, 2025
 Workshop:                             November 24-25, 2025

LOCATION
 The workshop will be held at TU Wien, Austria.

PROCEEDINGS
 TAASP is a non-archival venue and there will be no published
 proceedings. However, informal proceedings will be provided and the
 papers will be posted informally on the workshop website. Therefore,
 it will be possible to submit to other conferences and journals both
 in parallel and subsequent to TAASP 2025.
