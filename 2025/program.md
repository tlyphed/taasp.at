**Towards Deep and Interpretable Rule Learning** \
Inductive rule learning is concerned with the learning of classification rules from data. Learned rules are inherently interpretable and easy to implement, so they are very suitable for formulating learned models in many domains. Nevertheless, current rule learning algorithms have several shortcomings. First, with respect to the current praxis of equating high interpretability with low complexity, we argue that while shorter rules are important for discrimination, longer rules are often more interpretable than shorter rules, and that the tendency of current rule learning algorithms to strive for short and concise rules should be replaced with alternative methods that allow for longer concept descriptions. Second, we think that the main impediment of current rule learning algorithms is that they are not able to learn deeply structured rule sets, unlike the successful deep learning techniques. Both points are currently under investigation in our group, and we will illustrate our progress with some results.

**Tackling Grounding Bottleneck through Compilation-Based ASP Solving** \
The success of Answer Set Programming (ASP) arises from its highly expressive declarative language capable of modeling complex combinatorial problems and from the availability of efficient solvers that make ASP a practical tool for real-world applications.
However, standard ASP systems based on the Ground & Solve paradigm suffer from an intrinsic limitation known as the grounding bottleneck. To overcome this limitation, compilation-based ASP solving has been recently proposed and has proven to be very effective in tackling the grounding bottleneck problem. \
In this tutorial, we will provide an overview of compilation-based ASP solving, so that attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of this technique and its potential for efficiently evaluating ASP programs. We first recall the standard methodology adopted by state-of-the-art ASP systems, highlighting both its strengths and limitations. Then, we present the main idea behind compilation-based ASP solving, which consists of compiling logical rules into dedicated propagators. Finally, we introduce ProASP, the first compilation-based ASP solver, discussing its internal working principles and illustrating how it enables the integration of the Ground & Solve and compilation-based approaches into a unified framework, capable of constructing problem-specific solvers tailored to the requirements of a given ASP program.
