### Aims and scope
Answer set programming (ASP) is a widely used declarative programming paradigm based on the stable-model semantics. Over the years, the formalism has been extended with new language elements, advanced evaluation techniques have been developed, and efficient and expressive systems have been realized. These advancements turned ASP into a rich modeling language that was successfully applied to various tasks in artificial intelligence and beyond, including combinatorial problems and knowledge-intense tasks. Driven by the needs of applications, ongoing research in the field comprises, for instance, the integration with other paradigms (such as constraint programming), distributed computation, temporal and stream reasoning. These developments aim at the ultimate goal of equipping ASP with the features needed for realizing modern information systems. This workshop focuses on recent trends in the area of ASP, including novel techniques for the evaluation of ASP programs, extensions of the formalism, integration with other formalisms, advancements of systems, and benchmark suites. Furthermore, discussions of applications of ASP and its extensions in AI and industry are welcome.

### Submissions
We welcome two categories of submissions:

- full papers presenting original research (at most 15 pages plus
   references and optional appendix), and
- extended abstracts of already published or preliminary research
   (at most 2 pages plus references and optional appendix).

All submissions should be in the Springer LNCS format:
https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines

Paper submission will be handled electronically by means of the Easychair system. All submissions will be peer-reviewed.
The submission page is available here:

### Important Dates
Can be found on the [respective page](/taasp.at/dates).

### Location
 The workshop will be held at Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t Klagenfurt, Austria.

### Proceedings
 TAASP is a non-archival venue and there will be no published
 proceedings. However, informal proceedings will be provided and the
 papers will be posted informally on the workshop website. Therefore,
 it will be possible to submit to other conferences and journals both
 in parallel and subsequent to TAASP 2024.
