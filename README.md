## Creating a new Subsite

If you want to create a "new" subsite for the next year, you have to do the following:

1) Copy the folder for the previous year and adapt the year.
2) Copy the template\<year\>.html in `_layouts` and adapt the year in the file name and inside.
3) Inside the markdown files for the new year, change the `layout` to the new template.
4) Update the redirect in `index.html` to point to the new subsite.
5) Adapt the content.
