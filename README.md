## Creating a new Year Subsite

If you want to create a "new" subsite for the next year, you have to do the following:

1) Copy the folder for the previous year and adapt the year.
4) Update the redirect in `index.html` to point to the new subsite.
5) Adapt the content and possibly delete some pages (for now).
